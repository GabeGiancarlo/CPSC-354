## Natural Number Game Analysis

The Natural Number Game report demonstrates the bridge between natural language mathematical reasoning and formal proof systems:

- **Lean Proof Solutions**: Complete solutions for Tutorial World Levels 5-8 with detailed explanations
- **Addition World Level 5**: Two complete solutions for associativity of addition - one using induction and one without induction
- **Mathematical Proofs**: Corresponding pen-and-paper proofs for both inductive and non-inductive approaches
- **Natural Language Proof**: Step-by-step English explanation of the mathematical reasoning behind `2 + 2 = 4`
- **Formal Verification**: Analysis of how Lean tactics capture the essence of mathematical proof
- **Academic Discussion**: Thoughtful questions about proof tactics and rewrite strategies

## Repository Organization

- **Primary Deliverable**: `Report/report.tex` - The consolidated master report
- **Archive**: `Individual Homeworks/` - All original homework files preserved for reference
- **Additional Work**: `nng_tutorial_report.md` - Natural Number Game formal verification analysis
- **Clean Structure**: Organized for easy navigation and professional presentation

## Submission

All assignments have been completed and consolidated into a comprehensive report. The master report follows course guidelines and LaTeX formatting standards, providing a complete overview of programming language theory from formal systems through advanced functional programming concepts.
